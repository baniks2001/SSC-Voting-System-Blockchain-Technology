Run Script to run the System:
Easy Method: For 1 time use Start-electron.bat by typing that in the terminal
Please Make sure first to create a the .env in the root directory and paste the content of environmenta(.emv).txt

Step 1: Clean/Reset Blockchain
	node scripts/clean-reset.js (run first if want fresh/no data in the blockchain if you want the data exists last voting do not clean)

Step 2: Run Blockchain Dual Node
	npm run start-nodes    (this will run the dual blockchain node also wait for 20 - 30 seconds before step 3 to make sure blockchain 	node is running)
	
Step 3: Compile and Deploy
	3.1 node scripts/compile.js		(this will compile the contract address and other more for the blockchain)
	3.2 node scripts/deploy.js 		(this will deploy the compiled contract and etc.)

Step 4. Setup .env for deployment
	4.1 ipconfig		Trace your IP Address on connected wifi/hotspot
	4.2 Change the 192.168.254.123 ip to your ip address then save
	    CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173,http://192.168.254.123:5173
	    ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173,http://192.168.254.123:5173,http://localhost:3000,http:192.168.254.123:3000

	    VITE_API_URL=http://192.168.254.123:5000

Step 5: Run Backend
	5.1 Run/start The Xampp Apache and the mysql (preferared to run this first before the step 1)
	5.2 Cd server
	5.3 npm run dev:network		(network)
	    npm run dev 			(localhost)  

Step 6: Run the Frontend
	npm run dev -- --host   (network)
	npm run dev 			(localhost)  

	Open/Paste the http://192.168.254.123:5173 that you have setup ipaddress that you provided in the .env and open/paste it to your 	browser
